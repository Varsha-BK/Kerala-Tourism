It is the largest fort in Kerala, spreading over 40 acres (160,000 m2).The fort appears to emerge from the sea. Almost three-quarters of its exterior is in contact with water. Bekal fort was not an administrative centre and does not include any palaces or mansions. <br> An important feature is the water-tank, magazine and the flight of steps leading to an observation tower built by Tipu Sultan. Standing at the centre of the fort, this offers views of the coastline and the towns of Kanhangad, Pallikkara, Bekal, Mavval, Kottikkulam, and Uduma.</p>

Built-in the typical Kerala style, Malik Ibn Dinar Masjid is one of the best kept and most attractive in the Kasaragod district.
                               <br> The mosque located in the famed Thalankara village is one of the earliest mosques built in Malabar. 
                               Malik Dinar resembles a palace built in the typical Kerala style of architecture. It has two storeys and massive beams. The structure that stands today is not the original one that Dinar constructed. Initially, it was only a small structure with a thatched roof.
